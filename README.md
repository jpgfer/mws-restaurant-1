## Project Overview: Stage 1

In **Stage One**, the student will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. The student will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.

**Status**: DONE

## Project Overview: Stage 2

 In **Stage Two**, the student will take the responsive, accessible design built in **Stage One** and connect it to an external server. The student will begin by using asynchronous JavaScript to request JSON data from the server. The student will store data received from the server in an offline database using IndexedDB, which will create an app shell architecture. Finally, the student will work to optimize the site to meet performance benchmarks, which the student will test using [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/).

**Status**: DONE

## Project Overview: Stage 3

 In **Stage Three**, you will take the connected application built in **Stage One** and **Stage Two** and add additional functionality. The student will add a form to allow users to create their own reviews. If the app is offline, the form will defer updating to the remote database until a connection is established. Finally, the student will work to optimize the site to meet even stricter performance benchmarks than the previous project, and test again using [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/).

**Status**: under way
